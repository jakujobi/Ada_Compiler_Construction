# Assignment A5b: Semantic Analysis Phase Driver

This directory contains the driver and test inputs for **Assignment A5b: Semantic Analysis Phase** of the Ada compiler course.

## Contents

- `JohnA5b.py`: Driver program that runs the complete compilation pipeline:
  1. Lexical Analysis
  2. Syntax Analysis (recursive-descent parser)
  3. Semantic Analysis (NewSemanticAnalyzer)
  4. Final compilation summary and error reporting
- `t*.ada`: Sample Ada source files (`t51.ada` through `t58.ada`) used for semantic tests
- `logs/`: Directory for log outputs generated by the driver

## How to Run

1. Change to this directory:
   ```sh
   cd assignments/A5b_New_Semantic_Analyzer
   ```
2. Run the driver on a test file:
   ```sh
   python JohnA5b.py t51.ada
   ```
3. Optionally provide an output file path:
   ```sh
   python JohnA5b.py t51.ada results.txt
   ```
4. Review the console output for syntax and semantic errors. Check the `logs/` folder for detailed logs if logging is configured.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- The `jakadac` compiler modules under `src/jakadac/modules`

## Implementation Notes

- **BaseDriver**: `JohnA5b` extends the `BaseDriver` class to manage phases and logging.
- **Phase 1**: Tokenization via `LexicalAnalyzer` producing a token list.
- **Phase 2**: Parsing via `RDParser`, with optional parse-tree construction.
- **Phase 3**: Semantic checks via `NewSemanticAnalyzer` using a fresh `SymbolTable`.
- The driver captures and reports `syntax_errors` and `semantic_errors` arrays.
- To increase verbosity, adjust the logger level in `main()` (e.g., use `logging.DEBUG`).
