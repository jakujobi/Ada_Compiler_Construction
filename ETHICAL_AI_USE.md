# Statement on the Use of AI Tools in the `jakadac` Ada Compiler Project

**Date:** April 20, 2025

**Author:** John Akujobi

## Introduction

This document outlines the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools during the development of the `jakadac` Ada compiler project for CSC 446 - Compiler Construction. The purpose of this statement is to provide transparency regarding how these tools were employed as aids in the development process while affirming that the core intellectual work adheres strictly to academic integrity policies.

## Core Principle: AI as an Augmentative Tool

AI tools were utilized selectively as assistants to enhance productivity, learning, and code quality. They were **NOT** used to generate complete solutions, bypass fundamental learning objectives, or substitute for the core problem-solving, design, and implementation efforts required by the assignments. The final project represents my own understanding, design choices, and coding efforts.

## Specific AI Tool Usage

The following AI tools were consulted or used for specific, limited tasks:

* **Concept Exploration and Learning:**
  * **Perplexity AI:** Used for searching and retrieving information regarding specific compiler construction concepts or algorithms encountered during the project.
  * **ChatGPT (Advanced Voice Mode):** Engaged conversationally to discuss and deepen understanding of complex theoretical concepts related to compilers, acting as a virtual tutor.
  * **NotebookLM:** Utilized to review and query personal notes taken during class lectures and study sessions.
* **Code Review and Refinement:**
  * **Google Assistant / GitHub Copilot Review:** Employed after making pull requests to perform code reviews on self-written code, identifying potential areas for improvement, suggesting alternative implementations, or pointing out possible bugs based on patterns. The suggestions were critically evaluated before any adoption.
* **Code Assistance and Generation (Limited Scope):**
  * **DeepCoder (Run Locally):** Used occasionally to generate small, utility code snippets (e.g., specific helper functions or methods) based on clear specifications provided by me. Also used to assist in generating routine comments and docstrings for self-written code.
  * **Cody AI:** Utilized to generate examples of test data structures or inputs based on defined requirements, helping to create comprehensive test cases.
* **Documentation:**
  * AI assistance was used moderately to help draft or refine sections of project documentation, primarily for clarity and formatting.

## Developer Contribution and Academic Integrity

While the tools above provided assistance in specific areas, the following core aspects of the project were solely my own work:

* **Overall Program Design and Architecture:** The high-level structure, modularization choices, and data flow were designed and planned by me.
* **Problem-Solving and Algorithm Implementation:** The core logic for the lexical analyzer, parser (including grammar interpretation and implementation), semantic analyzer (including symbol table logic and type checking rules), and overall compiler pipeline was developed through my own problem-solving efforts based on course materials and concepts.
* **Debugging:** Identifying and resolving logical errors, runtime issues, and algorithmic flaws was primarily my own undertaking, though AI tools occasionally helped identify syntax errors or suggest debugging approaches.
* **Majority of Code Implementation:** The substantial majority of the functional code across all modules was written and implemented by me. AI-generated snippets were limited to small, well-defined utility functions and were integrated and adapted as needed.
